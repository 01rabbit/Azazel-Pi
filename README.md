## Concept

Do you know the term **Delaying Action**? In military strategy, this refers to a defensive operation where defending forces continue to fight while avoiding decisive engagement, slowing the enemy's advance as much as possible to buy time. In today's cyber warfare, attacks are fast and automated, with assets potentially compromised within seconds. We believe this classical tactical concept should be reinterpreted and applied to modern cybersecurity.

Based on this philosophy, we developed the **Azazel System**. This tool implements a **scapegoat-style decoy** that absorbs attacks, misleads adversaries, and tactically delays their progress. Unlike traditional honeypots that merely observe, Azazel actively restrains attackers, realizing **delaying action in cyberspace**.

The system is designed as a **portable security gateway** that proactively protects users when connecting to **untrusted external networks** such as hotel Wi-Fi, event venues, or when defending **temporary lab environments**.

While the modern battlefield has shifted to cyberspace, the concept of "restraining the enemy to buy time" remains valid. **Azazel System** embodies one answer to tactical "cyber containment" in digital warfare.

## Design Principles

The defensive philosophy of **Azazel System** draws inspiration from two Japanese tactical concepts:

**Battlefield Containment**: Based on the Imperial Japanese Army's defensive principle of "binding the enemy to the battlefield." Rather than simply blocking attacks, this approach deliberately draws adversaries into a controlled environment, restricting their freedom of action while buying time for preparation and counteroffensives. Azazel similarly guides intruders into decoys and communication delays, constraining attack vectors and transferring initiative to the defender.

**Go no Sen (後の先)**: An advanced martial arts strategy of "taking initiative in response." Though appearing reactive, this technique uses the opponent's movement to gain control and create counterattack opportunities. Azazel implements this philosophy by triggering delay controls after Suricata detection, deliberately accepting, observing, and controlling attacks—embodying this tactical response pattern.

Thus, Azazel realizes the concept that "defense is not merely protection, but controlling enemy behavior and buying time"—a cyber deception tool rooted in Japanese strategic thinking.

## Implementation

## Installation

### Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 5 Model B (recommended) or compatible ARM64 device
- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit Lite) or Debian-based distribution  
- Internet connection for dependency installation
- Administrator privileges (sudo access)
- Optional: Waveshare 2.13" E-Paper display for status visualization

### Quick Setup

After cloning the repository or downloading a release, run the automated installer as root:

```bash
cd Azazel-Pi
sudo scripts/install_azazel.sh
# To automatically start services after installation:
# sudo scripts/install_azazel.sh --start
```

The installer will:
- Install Suricata, Vector, OpenCanary, and other core components
- Deploy core modules and utilities to `/opt/azazel`
- Expand configuration templates to `/etc/azazel`
- Enable the unified `azctl-unified.service` systemd service

Before starting services, edit `/etc/azazel/azazel.yaml` to configure interface names, QoS profiles, and defensive thresholds for your environment.

For complete installation instructions, troubleshooting, and E-Paper setup, see [`docs/en/INSTALLATION.md`](docs/en/INSTALLATION.md).

### E-Paper Display Setup (Optional)

If using a Waveshare E-Paper display:

```bash
# Install E-Paper dependencies
sudo scripts/install_epd.sh

# Test the display
sudo python3 -m azazel_pi.core.display.epd_daemon --mode test

# Enable the E-Paper service
sudo systemctl enable --now azazel-epd.service
```

See [`docs/en/EPD_SETUP.md`](docs/en/EPD_SETUP.md) for complete E-Paper configuration instructions.

### Optional: Front Mattermost with Nginx

To serve Mattermost via Nginx reverse proxy (recommended), use the provided template and setup script:

```bash
sudo scripts/setup_nginx_mattermost.sh
```

This will:
- Install Nginx (if missing)
- Deploy the reverse proxy config from `deploy/nginx-site.conf`
- Enable the site and reload Nginx

Afterwards, Mattermost should be reachable at `http://<device-ip>/` (port 80) and proxied to `127.0.0.1:8065`.
For HTTPS, add your TLS server block or use Certbot.

### Modular TUI Menu System

The interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) menu provides comprehensive system management through a modular architecture designed for maintainability and extensibility:

```bash
# Launch the TUI menu
python3 -m azctl.cli menu

# With specific interface configuration
python3 -m azctl.cli menu --lan-if wlan0 --wan-if wlan1
```

**Modular Architecture:**

Azazel-Pi's menu system employs a modular design with functional separation for improved maintainability:

### Configuration Workflow

1. **Edit Core Configuration**: Modify `/etc/azazel/azazel.yaml` to adjust delay values, bandwidth controls, and lockdown allowlists (template at `configs/network/azazel.yaml`).
   - By default, `wlan0` is treated as the internal LAN (AP), and both `wlan1` and `eth0` are considered external (WAN/uplink) interfaces. See `interfaces.external: ["eth0", "wlan1"]` in `configs/network/azazel.yaml` and adjust as needed.

2. **Generate Suricata Rules**: Use `scripts/suricata_generate.py` to render environment-specific IDS configurations

3. **Restart Services**: Apply changes with `sudo systemctl restart azctl-unified.service`

4. **Health Check**: Verify service status using `scripts/sanity_check.sh`

5. **Monitor Operations**: Analyze scoring results in `decisions.log` and use `azctl` for manual mode switching during incidents

### Defensive Mode Operations

- **Portal Mode**: Baseline monitoring with minimal network impact
- **Shield Mode**: Activated by moderate threat scores; applies traffic shaping and enhanced logging
- **Lockdown Mode**: Triggered by high-severity alerts; restricts all traffic except medical/emergency FQDNs

Mode transitions are logged to `/var/log/azazel/decisions.log` with timestamps, scores, and triggering events.

## Development Background

Modern cyber attacks are increasingly fast and automated, making traditional honeypots insufficient. This system is designed not merely for **observation or blocking, but for tactical delay**—turning time into a defensive asset.

The core philosophy recognizes that in asymmetric cyber warfare, defenders often cannot prevent initial compromise but can control the attacker's subsequent actions. By implementing strategic delays and misdirection, Azazel creates opportunities for detection, analysis, and response.

## What's New

- **E-Paper Display Integration** (inspired by Azazel-Zero): Real-time status visualization showing current defensive mode, threat score, network status, and alert counters with boot/shutdown animations
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Terminal-based monitoring with color-coded mode indicators and live updates
- **Modular Configuration**: Declarative configuration system with JSON schema validation
- **Portable Design**: Optimized for field deployment and temporary network protection
- **Automated Provisioning**: Single-script installation with dependency management

## Deployment Status

**Current Status**: **95% Combat Ready** 🚀

### ✅ Operational Components
- **Traffic Control System**: tc delay injection (100ms/200ms/300ms) with integrated DNAT+QoS
- **Threat Detection**: Suricata IDS with real-time OpenCanary traffic diversion
- **Network Services**: WiFi AP (Azazel_Internal), DHCP/DNS, external network connectivity
- **Core Services**: azctl-unified (AI control daemon), vector log processing, opencanary honeypot
- **Auto-startup**: All critical services automatically start on boot

### 🔧 Remaining Items
- E-Paper display functionality (hardware-dependent, tracked in issues)

The system is **field-deployable** and provides complete malicious traffic delay capabilities with automatic threat detection and response.
