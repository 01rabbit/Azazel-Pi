# Azazel Architecture

Azazel packages the SOC/NOC control plane into a self-contained repository. The
solution is designed so a clean Raspberry Pi image can pull a tagged release and
become operational without ad-hoc configuration.

## Core services

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `azazel_core/state_machine.py` | Governs transitions between posture states. |
| `azazel_core/actions/` | Models tc/nftables operations as idempotent plans. |
| `azazel_core/ingest/` | Parses Suricata EVE logs and OpenCanary events. |
| `azazel_core/qos/` | Maps profiles to QoS enforcement classes. |
| `azctl/` | Thin CLI/daemon interface used by systemd. |
| `azctl/tui_zero.py` + `azctl/tui_zero_textual.py` | Unified Textual TUI (Azazel-Zero port). |
| `configs/` | Declarative configuration set including schema validation. |
| `scripts/install_azazel.sh` | Provisioning script that stages the runtime and dependencies. |
| `systemd/` | Units and targets that compose the Azazel service stack. |

## State machine overview

The state machine promotes or demotes the defensive posture based on the score
calculated from incoming alerts. Three stages are modelled:

1. **Idle** – default, minimal restrictions.
2. **Shield** – elevated monitoring, tc shaping applied.
3. **Lockdown** – optional stage triggered by high scores where nftables rules
   restrict ingress to trusted ranges.

The scoring logic lives in `azazel_core/scorer.py` and is exercised by the unit
tests under `tests/unit`.

## Configuration

All runtime parameters are stored inside `configs/azazel.yaml`. A JSON Schema is
published in `configs/azazel.schema.json` and enforced in CI. Vendor
applications—Suricata, Vector, OpenCanary, nftables and tc—are provided with
opinionated defaults that can be adapted per deployment.

## TUI Architecture

Azazel-Pi uses a unified Textual UI ported from Azazel-Zero.

```
azctl/cli.py                  # `menu` subcommand entry
azctl/tui_zero.py             # Azazel-Pi adapters (snapshot/action mapping)
azctl/tui_zero_textual.py     # Textual application layout + key bindings
```

Execution flow:

1. Operator runs `python3 -m azctl.cli menu`.
2. `cmd_menu()` delegates to `azctl.tui_zero.run_menu()`.
3. Snapshot loader prefers `runtime/ui_snapshot.json`; fallback is `azctl status --json`.
4. Textual actions (`stage_open`, `reprobe`, `contain`) are translated to mode events (`portal`, `shield`, `lockdown`).

## Packaging goal

`install_azazel.sh` installs Azazel onto `/opt/azazel`, copies configuration
and systemd units into place, and ensures Debian dependencies are present. The
repository layout mirrors the staged filesystem, ensuring releases are
reproducible. Tagging a commit triggers the release workflow that builds
`azazel-installer-<tag>.tar.gz` containing the entire payload required for
air-gapped installs.
